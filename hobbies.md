<br>After two years of working in the laboratory, programming has become a habit and a way of thinking for me. Applying mathematical tools in an engineering fashion makes all challenges manageable. The process of reading literature and colliding ideas with others deeply fascinates me. As my good friend puts it, I am quite the romantic, and this lifestyle allows me to maintain continuous motivation even in the face of pressure. I love my work just as passionately as I love life!
