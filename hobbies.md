<br>After two years of working in the laboratory, programming has become a habit and a way of thinking for me. Applying mathematical tools in an engineering fashion makes all challenges manageable. The process of reading literature and colliding ideas with others deeply fascinates me. As my good friend puts it, I am quite the romantic, and this lifestyle allows me to maintain continuous motivation even in the face of pressure. I love my work just as passionately as I love life!

## Swimming & Surfing

<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Cat

This is my love. Her name is Qbo (QÂÆù).
