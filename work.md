## A couple of topics I've been thinking about

- [**KGCN4Comp: The short text processing mechanism of Chinese complaints**]()<br> <font color='red'>[**[PDF]**](https://kangjiaju.github.io/mypaper/KGCN4Comp.pdf)</font><br>

    · In China, government complaint departments receive a large volume of complaints from citizens every day, covering various topics such as food safety concerns, contract issues, violations of public facilities usage, and unreasonable business practices. The traditional approach of government departments involves human phone operators categorizing these complaints into a multi-label classification system upon receiving them, after which responsible officials from different departments periodically handle these issues. As one can imagine, under the daily task load of tens of thousands of complaints, this method incurs significant costs.<br>
    · Therefore, we aim to implement a machine learning approach to achieve equally effective classification results, and even predict which departments may collaborate more effectively based on the complaint text. In an intriguing scenario, the algorithm would start transcribing the conversation into text and ask the user for necessary information in the first second of the call. Users would only need to comply. After the call concludes, the algorithm would produce the best classification result.<br>

    · Lately, I've developed a keen interest in a captivating subject that revolves around the art of engineering prompts for sophisticated large language models, exploring the multimodal capabilities of LLMs, and delving into autonomous drone path planning.<br>
    · This endeavor can be succinctly described as follows: creating a comprehensive command-generation system based on large language models to achieve autonomous flight control and path planning for quadcopter drones. The primary objective is to establish a direct mapping from **"orders"** to robot **"behavior"** within the realm of interactive experiences. This approach deviates from the conventional method of manually crafting instruction sets, which necessitates extensive data collection and complex instruction sequence management, often in a supervised or semi-supervised manner—an approach known for its high cost and limited applicability. Instead, we aim to leverage the power of large models for inference, providing valuable cues for path planning and thereby enhancing the zero-shot generalization capabilities of drone systems.<br>
