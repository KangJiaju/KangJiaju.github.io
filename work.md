## A couple of topics I've been thinking about

- [Trajectory generation and control architecture of zero-sample aircraft based on GPT-4]()
* Lately, I've developed a keen interest in a captivating subject that revolves around the art of engineering prompts for sophisticated large language models, exploring the multimodal capabilities of LLMs, and delving into autonomous drone path planning.
* This endeavor can be succinctly described as follows: creating a comprehensive command-generation system based on large language models to achieve autonomous flight control and path planning for quadcopter drones. The primary objective is to establish a direct mapping from "commands" to robot "behavior" within the realm of interactive experiences. This approach deviates from the conventional method of manually crafting instruction sets, which necessitates extensive data collection and complex instruction sequence management, often in a supervised or semi-supervised mannerâ€”an approach known for its high cost and limited applicability. Instead, we aim to leverage the power of large models for inference, providing valuable cues for path planning and thereby enhancing the zero-shot generalization capabilities of drone systems.
