## Research interest

- Machine Learning
- Visual servo autonomous unmanned system
- Environment modeling algorithms using new sensors
- Robot control integrated with LLM

My current research focuses on the perception and modeling of the surrounding environment of intelligent systems, especially cluster perception. My interests are **Autonomous unmanned systems** and their application to **Group Perception in Decision Making**. In short, design interconnected clusters with common visual capabilities to make the best decisions. I hope to dedicate my talents to this meaningful cause and bring benefits to society.
