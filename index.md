## Research interest

- Multimodal remote sensing LLMs
- Illusion correcting, continuous learning, and quantization compression of LLMs
- Application of LLMs in public social governance

My current research interests lie in efficiently **Correcting Illusions**, **Continuous Learning**, and **Quantization Compression** of Large Language Models (LLMs) in general scenarios. I am also focused on enhancing the **Image-Text Retrieval Capabilities of Multi-modal LLMs** in challenging fields such as remote sensing. The practical application of LLMs, particularly in the domain of public administration, faces various challenges. A long-term project in collaboration with LSE, UCL, FU Berlin, and ESIGELEC has prompted me to contemplate how governmental departments and technical teams can promote the use of LLMs in public administration.
