Abstract: This invention discloses a method for estimating transportation modes based on mobile signaling data, which pertains to the field of mobile traffic communication technology.  It primarily relies on spatiotemporal information from mobile signaling data to determine the origin and destination points of transportation trips.  Subsequently, it proposes evaluation criteria such as average speed, speed variance, 85th percentile speed, dwell time per kilometer, and dwell point spacing.  Finally, it utilizes clustering algorithms to group similar trips based on their features, assigns transportation categories, and determines the thresholds for the evaluation criteria.
In this study, mobile signaling data from multi-mode trips was collected using the AdaBase station road testing tool for testing purposes. The research demonstrates that this model achieves an accuracy rate of up to 95.45%. This research can provide technical support for multi-mode transportation planning and control, offering valuable guidance for optimizing multi-mode transportation facilities and passenger flow management.
